## Cryptography, the science of secret writing

### Week 1
#### Terminology

- Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication.
- Steganography, the science of hiding messages in other messages or images.
- CIA triad, that means confidentiality, integrity and availability
- Confidentiality, **no improper disclosure of information** (Information is not learned by unauthorized principals).
- Integrity, **no improper modification of information** (Information has not been modified by unauthorized principals).
- Availability, **no improper impairment of functionality / service** (Information can be accessed by authorized principals).
- Identification, associating an identity with a subject.
- Authentication, verifying the validity of something (usually the claimed identity of a system entity), **Principals or data origin can be identified accurately**.
- Authorization, granting or denying the permissions of a system entity to access a resource.
- Accountability, the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that entity.
- Physical access controls, controls access to physical resources, such as a PC or paper records.
- Logical access controls, controls access to electronic systems and resources, such as databases and electronic records.
- Discretionary access control (DAC), the owner of the object decides which subjects have which privileges.
- Mandatory access control (MAC), system-wide policies define subject access to objects, and owners cannot change this.
- Role based access control (RBAC), access is based on a common set of privileges that apply to all subjects in the same role.
- Rule-based access control (RAC), access to objects is based on a list of rules defined by the owners for each subject.

#### Other
- Access Control Matrix Model, a protection state (relative to a set of privileges **P**) is a triple (**S**,**O**,**M**).
